# Network Traffic Detection
A live network traffic detection application.

#Overview:
This live network traffic detection app monitors network traffic in real-time. It detects internet usage by actively running applications. It is built using Python and its following libraries: psutil, scapy, pyshark, tkinter (for GUI).


#Motivation:
This application was created out of the need to know which applications consume the most bandwidth. It aims to fill the gap in traditional task managers which provide limited insights. This network detection app will help pinpoint the issue in a user-friendly way. 


#Features:
- Real time monitoring: Displays live network statistics for each active process.
- Visualises network protocol usage: Uses a live chart for insights.
- Tracks per-process network usage: Monitors bytes sent/received per process.
- Error Handling: Prevents crashes by handling exceptions.
